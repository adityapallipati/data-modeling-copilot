# data-modeling-copilot
This project will incorporate the LangGraph library and GraphRAG architecture using locally available LLM(s) and embedding models in order to data model given an input CSV. The goal of this project is to showcase the value of agents in a corporate environment where resources are limited to pre-approved models.
